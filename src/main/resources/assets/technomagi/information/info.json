    "After hundreds of years of living alongside each other, the races that were once protected, guided and helped by the TechnoMages rose up at the hand of religious zealots. It was said that the TechnoMages were trying to replace god, that they were trying to live like gods and that they bathed in heresy. Using the technological gifts that were bestowed upon them by the TechnoMages, the zealots drove the order right to the end.",
    "In a last ditch attempt to continue the order, the elders gathered the initiates that they were protecting and performed their rites, which would make them a fully fledged member of the order. The elders equipped each initiate with internal nanites and prepared to send them to alternate worlds, instances, dimensions and universes, where they would be safe from the onslaught. Each initiate's nanites were equipped with the basics of the knowledge that the the order had accumulated over the many years since they first came to be.",
    "Unfortunately as the elders were performing the final part of the process the zealots broke through into the archives and interrupted, causing all the initiates to be thrown into the void, scattered across the known universes, cut off from home, dead or alive.",
    "You were one of those initiates, your job is to survive, collect knowledge, explore and understand, and try to contact any others who may have survived."
